Disordered residue predictions in absolute-path/examples/example.diso

Protein binding disordered residue predictions in absolute-path/examples/example.pbdat


example.diso:

Results are saved in plain ASCII text format. Disordered region predictions are presented
in tabular format with four fields on each line representing the amino acid position, the
residue single letter code, the order/disorder assignment code, and the corresponding
confidence level. Ordered residues are marked with dots (.) and have scores in [0.00, 0.49];
disordered residues are labelled with asterisks (*) and are scored in [0.50, 1.00].
